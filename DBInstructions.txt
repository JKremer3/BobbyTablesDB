First create a database.
Create tables from DBschema.
Modify newparser.js to include your database info. (There is a TODO tag for this).
If you dare, run python3 newparser.js (Allow for about 30-40 minutes to fill database).

Alternatively and much faster:
First create a database called business.
psql business < businessDB.SQL
Done!
